##Password Generator Challenge
This challenge was, indeed, a challenge. I was very eager to jump in as JavaScript was exactly what I had failed to teach myself in my independent studies. As my first JavaScript assignment, I learned a great deal about modifying arrays and objects to meet specific criteria. This finished page may be used to generate a password with parameters of your choice between 8-128 characters. I, very stubbornly, challenged myself with this project by refusing to use window prompts and instead using a form within the html to gather the information for the password against all advice to do so, simply because I think the window prompts are ugly.
